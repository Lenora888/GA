        <h2><i><b><u>Who Am I really?</i><b></u></h2>
              <p id="L"/>I am someone who has been undergoing alot of change this year, and I am discovering who I really am with everything that is happening!  I am someone who is digging deep to find my next big adventure in life!  </p>

              <p id="special1"> This year I bought a house, lost a job, bought a new mini cooper countryman,starting using a MAC, tried river rafting and kayaking, and started to really look at some of the things I never really looked at carefully, like finances, and I began to clean house so to speak! </p>

              <p>All the change I had been going through really caused me to stop and look at how I took things for granted and how wasteful I had been over the years. The stress I had undergone at work, caused me to snap at my family at times, and I realized this is not who I wanted to be.  I began to use some of my new free time at home to repair my relationships and to not be so wasteful. I finally started to feel like some of the bricks I had been carrying around for years were starting to fall off, and it's starting to feel good!</p>

        <p>The latest vacation my family and I went on took place in August at Lake George, and it was here that I discovered that I really enjoy river rafting and kayaking.  This has definately been the year of newness and trying new things! In the past, I's normally enjoy being on an island tanning with a drink in hand and an appointment to get a massage!  I never thought that being on river and getting soaked could be so beautiful, peaceful and fun! </p> 
      
         
         <h2><b>So let me tell you a little more about myself, and then I will let you know where I am heading, or think I am heading! LOL!</b></h2>

         <br />


          <p>After 25 years of working in the Intimate Apparel Industry, the company I worked for as a VP of Operations closed. I was fortunate to work for someone who trusted me and gave me access to all parts of his business until he passed away. I gained alot of experience throughout the years and learned all ends of the business.  Working all those years, with little or no breaks in between, I really did not know where to begin, but I realized that I needed a change.  I realized that I got comfortable in the industry I chose to be a part of, and made a great salary, but I truly wasn't happy with the players and wasn't too thrilled to return in another role in such a stressful enviornment.
          I began exploring what I might be happy doing and realized that between working crazy hours, being a wife and mother, and caring for my mom, I really did not have interests or hobbies to speak of.  I basically worked and surrounded my free time around my family and friends, with little time for anything that actually interested me. I tried to spend time doing things for them and making them happy and got lost somewhere. I really did not know where to begin, and so, I started to look around and see what kind of jobs my family and friends had, but not many sparked any of my interest. Some were interesting, but I didn't feel that I had the qualifications to try out for them, mostly out of fear of failure with something new.  Too much was changing in my world and I was truly afraid.</p>

          <p>My husband threw a wrench into my world by talking me into going back to school and learning something completely new. <em>Me</em> -- put my head down and learn again after so many years? <em>OMG,</em> I was so scared out of my skull! Again, I had no idea where to start and he suggested coding.  Being a software developer, he encouraged me that the world of code needs more females and so, my journey began and here I am! Totally scared and curious, but willing to work hard!</p>

          <p> So this was the year we purchased a new car. Again, I had no idea of what car to get, I couldn't afford the Aston Martin that I really had my eye on, so we decided to have fun with the Mini Cooper Countryman.  There wasn't enough change in my life so I decided to go with a stick shift, just to spice things up! LOL.</p>
